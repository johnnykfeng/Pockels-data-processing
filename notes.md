There is a Calib struct variable that eventually get's saved as .mat file

Calib file get's updated in the code, which introduces a lot of redundancy when assigning variables

Code is very bloated, hard to follow large codes when there is not clearly defined functions that state output and inputs. 
Some modularization is needed to make the code understandable.
